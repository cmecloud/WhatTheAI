# WhatTheAI
This is an AI and Data Testing GitHub Repo documenting my journey through AI and what I will discover. I am stepping outside my comfort zone to share and upload my code to Git Hub. Most of my development has always been in a private repository or offline. I am an explorer in this technical space. So I will share code-related areas of interest, and let's see where it leads.

This project will focus on testing AI and data-related services by exploring the performance of AI models, algorithms, and data processing pipelines.

I plan to document and find various resources for effectively testing AI and data services. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

1. Code Samples: Discover and share a collection of code samples demonstrating different testing techniques, frameworks, and methodologies tailored for AI and data services. These samples will help you gain insights into testing strategies, data validation, model evaluation, and more.

2. Documentation: mstechdiva.com contains the blog. I will develop additional documentation, including guides, tutorials, and best practices, to assist you in understanding the details of testing AI and data-related services. It may cover databases, unit testing for ML models, performance benchmarking, and integration testing.

3. Tools and Utilities: Access a curated set of tools and utilities developed to simplify the testing process for AI and data services. These resources aim to enhance your productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and provide valuable insights into the performance and robustness of your AI systems.

I am open to feedback about this repository by submitting bug reports, suggesting enhancements, or sharing insights through pull requests. Your contributions and feedback are vital in my learning about this space.

If you have any questions, need assistance, or want to discuss ideas related to AI and data testing, please feel free to reach out. I'd be more than happy to assist you.

Thanks for visiting my repo.
